<h1>Web metronome.</h1>
<h4>Few months ago I woke up and felt like drumming. So I headed to the music store and bought sticks and training pad. Started practicing this and that, watched videos. And everybody in the videos was like: "use metronome, use metronome..." So I decided why not to try built it myself?? Here's the early result.</h4>
<h5>v 0.1</h5>
<p>First "ready-to-use" prototype. It actually works. Nothing more to say) The problem was huge drift of setTimeout or setInterval. So I found on the internet some timer constructor function and used it here. The idea of that function is to neutralize the drift. And it works, but still not perfect. Timer corrects every milliseconds loss on every repeat, but the actuall loss is sometimes that big, you can hear it. It's not good. Some perfomance troubles. Got stuck. Will try to find some way out. Maybe you have some ideas?)</p>
